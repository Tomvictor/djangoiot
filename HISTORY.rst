History
=======

I started the djangoiot project back in 2016. It was a
busy season of my life. I was working full-time for my electronic startup
company during that time and barely had any ideas about software development.
I just created the repo, added some code, and then procrastinated it at that
time. Recently, I noticed that more people are searching for drf-mqtt packages online.
Besides I got messages and emails enquiring about djangoiot and MQTT. So, after
the long 4 years, I finally got into execution mode and decided to restart my project.
